# FancyType

FancyType is an open-source typing test application inspired by [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com). This project aims to assist users in improving their typing speed and accuracy in a fun and interactive way.

## Project Overview

The application provides a user with random phrases to type. It measures the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and calculates the accuracy of the typed text. The interface provides real-time feedback by changing the input text color based on the correctness of the user's typing.

## Features

- Random phrases from a predefined list for users to type.
- Calculates typing speed in WPM.
- Displays typing accuracy in percentage.
- Resets functionality to start a new typing test.
- Shortcut keys for resetting the test using `Tab` or `Enter`.

## Future Improvements

We are actively looking for contributors to enhance FancyType's features. Some of the features we aim to incorporate include:

1. **Misspelled Words Display**: Show the words that users misspelled during the test, providing them an opportunity to practice and rectify their common mistakes.
2. **Dynamic Content**: Integrate an API to fetch excerpts from popular books or famous phrases, offering a richer and varied typing experience.
3. **Targeted Practice**: Allow users to practice typing the words they frequently misspell.
